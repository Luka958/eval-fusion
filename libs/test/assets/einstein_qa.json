            "Portrait of Einstein taken in\n1935 at Princeton\nFacsimile of the Einstein\u2013Szilard letter\n1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United\nStates and apply for citizenship.[142][149]\nEinstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until\nhis death in 1955.[150] He was one of the four first selected (along with\nJohn von Neumann, Kurt G\u00f6del, and Hermann Weyl[151]) at the new\nInstitute. He soon developed a close friendship with G\u00f6del; the two would\ntake long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his\nassistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to\ndevelop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of\nquantum physics, both unsuccessfully. He lived in Princeton at his home\nfrom 1935 onwards. The Albert Einstein House was made a National\nHistoric Landmark in 1976.\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that\nincluded \u00e9migr\u00e9 physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd attempted to\nalert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb\nresearch. The group's warnings were discounted.\nEinstein and Szil\u00e1rd, along with other refugees such\nas Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as\ntheir responsibility to alert Americans to the\npossibility that German scientists might win the race\nto build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler\nwould be more than willing to resort to such a\nweapon.\"[152][153] To make certain the US was\naware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months\nbefore the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szil\u00e1rd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the\npossibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.[154] He was asked\nto lend his support by writing a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay\nattention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\nThe letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into\nnuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\".[155] In addition to the letter, Einstein\nused his connections with the Belgian royal family[156] and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a\npersonal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his\nmeetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense\nmaterial, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.\nFor Einstein, \"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to\nRoosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.[157] In 1954, a year before his death,\nEinstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life\u2014when I signed the\nletter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification\u2014\nthe danger that the Germans would make them ...\"[158] In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and\nscientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of\nnuclear weapons.[159] In 1960 Einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the World\nWorld War II and the Manhattan Project"

The publications deeply\nimpressed Einstein's contemporaries.[82]\nEinstein's sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured a junior teaching\nposition at the University of Bern. In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the\nUniversity of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zurich's luring him away from Bern with a\nnewly created associate professorship.[83] Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when\nhe accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him to\nbecome an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was not completed.[84][85][86] His\ntime in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers.[87]\nIn July 1912, he returned to his alma mater, the ETH Zurich, to\ntake up a chair in theoretical physics. His teaching activities\nthere centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics,\nand his research interests included the molecular theory of heat,\ncontinuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic\ntheory of gravitation. In his work on the latter topic, he was\nassisted by his friend, Marcel Grossmann, whose knowledge of\nthe kind of mathematics required was greater than his own.[88]\nIn the spring of 1913, two German visitors, Max Planck and\nWalther Nernst, called upon Einstein in Zurich in the hope of\npersuading him to relocate to Berlin.[89] They offered him\nmembership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm\n1900\u20131905: First scientific papers\n1908\u20131933: Academic career in Europe"

Millikan, Georges\nLema\u00eetre and Einstein at the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology in\nJanuary 1933\nbrings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By\ncontrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that\nthe physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of\nclosely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.[243] The explanation for the decay in their orbital period\nwas that they were emitting gravitational waves.[243][244] Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11\nFebruary 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves,[245]\ndetected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the\nprediction.[243][246][247][248][249]\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory.\nHe formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.\nHe gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would\nbe invariant under general linear transformations only.[250]\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it\nwas a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of\nmotion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work,\nEinstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken[251] and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the\nstructure of the universe as a whole.[252] He discovered that the\ngeneral field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic,\neither contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a\ndynamic universe was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a\nnew term, the cosmological constant, into the field equations, in\norder to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified\nfield equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in\naccordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in\nthese years. This model became known as the Einstein World or\nEinstein's static universe.[253][254]\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by Edwin\nHubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the\nuniverse, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedmann\u2013Einstein universe of\n1931[255][256] and the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe of 1932.[257][258] In each of these models, Einstein\ndiscarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically\nunsatisfactory\".[255][256][259]\nIn many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later\nyears as his \"biggest blunder\", based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from him.

Aided by the Academic Assistance Council,\nfounded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi\npersecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[136] He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he\nlived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the\nBritish Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in\nthe preceding years.[131] Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded\nwooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-\nLampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein\nwas published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.[137][138]\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his\nhome, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister\nLloyd George.[139] Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish\nscientists out of Germany.

In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a\ndistant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's photosphere\n(that is, the Sun's apparent surface).

Incoming\nphotons on the left strike a metal\nplate (bottom), and eject electrons,\ndepicted as flying off to the right.\nIn general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of\nspacetime. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting\na body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall\nfreely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other\nmasses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial\namong physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to\nmove; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\"[272][273] The Einstein field\nequations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of\nspacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation\ncovers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that\nare as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. Einstein regarded this as\nan \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in\naddition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. Believing\nthis to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally\npresented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves.\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy\nmade out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined\nby the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the\nfield equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both\nphysicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained\nfrom applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains\ndisputed.[274][275]\nIn a 1905 paper,[224] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of\nlocalized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly\nuniversally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and\nNiels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919,\nwith Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric\neffect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated\nwith a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is the\nPlanck constant. He did not say much more, because he was not\nsure how the particles were related to the wave. But he did suggest\nthat this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably\nthe photoelectric effect.[224] Light quanta were dubbed photons by\nGilbert N. Lewis in 1926.[276]\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent\nharmonic oscillator.

He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York,[195] and was an\nhonorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th\nanniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture\nembodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He\nobserved, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\"[196]\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:\nThe word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses,\nthe Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty\nchildish.

I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.[197]\nEinstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth,\nvice-president of the German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund), he wrote:\nAlthough I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian\ndiet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle.

Aided by the Academic Assistance Council,\nfounded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi\npersecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[136] He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he\nlived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the\nBritish Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in\nthe preceding years.[131] Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded\nwooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-\nLampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein\nwas published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.[137][138]\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his\nhome, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister\nLloyd George.[139] Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish\nscientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes\nthat Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend,\nphysicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish\nscientists and place them in British universities.[140] Churchill\nlater observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews\nout, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the\nAllies' technology ahead of theirs.[140]\nEinstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including\nTurkey's Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, to whom he wrote in\nSeptember 1933, requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists.

Incoming\nphotons on the left strike a metal\nplate (bottom), and eject electrons,\ndepicted as flying off to the right.\nIn general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of\nspacetime. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting\na body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall\nfreely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other\nmasses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial\namong physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to\nmove; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\"[272][273] The Einstein field\nequations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of\nspacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation\ncovers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that\nare as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. Einstein regarded this as\nan \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in\naddition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. Believing\nthis to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally\npresented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves.\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy\nmade out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined\nby the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the\nfield equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both\nphysicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained\nfrom applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains\ndisputed.[274][275]\nIn a 1905 paper,[224] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of\nlocalized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly\nuniversally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and\nNiels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919,\nwith Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric\neffect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated\nwith a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is the\nPlanck constant. He did not say much more, because he was not\nsure how the particles were related to the wave. But he did suggest\nthat this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably\nthe photoelectric effect.[224] Light quanta were dubbed photons by\nGilbert N. Lewis in 1926.[276]\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent\nharmonic oscillator.

In classical wave theories, light is viewed as a continuous wave, where energy transfer occurs through the wave's amplitude. However, Einstein's theory, supported by experiments like the photoelectric effect, shows that the energy of light is quantized and directly proportional to its frequency (E=hf). This quantization explains phenomena that classical theories could not, such as the photoelectric effect itself, where light must reach a certain frequency to eject electrons from a metal surface. Thus, while classical theories focus on wave properties, Einstein's approach offers a more complete explanation of energy transfer involving light.",

            "object. Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second\ninstantaneously fast. Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from\nanother, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. Because the true \"physical\ncondition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein\nconcluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of\nit.[291][292]\nA more famous version of this argument came in 1935, when Einstein published a paper with Boris\nPodolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox.[293] In this\nthought experiment, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is\nentangled. Then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on\none particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other\nparticle. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise\nprediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any\nway. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since\nthis would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the theory of\nrelativity. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that: \"If,\nwithout in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to\nunity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that\nquantity.\" From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and\nof momentum prior to either quantity being measured. But quantum mechanics considers these two\nobservables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system.\nEinstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete\ndescription of reality.[294]\nIn 1964, John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if\nmeasurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the\nassumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical\nconstraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. This constraint would later be\ncalled a Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this\ninequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum\nphysics is if they are \"nonlocal\", which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact\ninstantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated.[295][296] Bell argued that because an\nexplanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR\nparadox \"is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least\".[297]\nDespite this, and although Einstein personally found the argument in the EPR paper overly\ncomplicated,[291][292] that paper became among the most influential papers published in Physical Review.\nIt is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.[298]\nEncouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical\ntheory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he\ndescribed his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of\nGravitation\".[299] His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not\nsuccess: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and\nUnified field theory"

Aided by the Academic Assistance Council,\nfounded  in April  1933  by  British  Liberal  politician  William  Beveridge  to  help  academics  escape  Nazi\npersecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[136] He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he\nlived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the\nBritish Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in\nthe  preceding  years.[131]  Locker-Lampson  invited  him  to  stay  near  his  Cromer  home  in  a  secluded\nwooden  cabin  on  Roughton  Heath  in  the  Parish  of  Roughton,  Norfolk.

In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel\nPrize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the\nphotoelectric effect\".[7] At this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity\nskeptically, and the Nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity\nthat it acknowledged: it did not assent to Einstein's notion of the particulate nature of light, which only\nwon over the entire scientific community when S. N. Bose derived the Planck spectrum in 1924. That\nsame year, Einstein was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and\nSciences.[96] Britain's closest equivalent of the Nobel award, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, was not\nhung around Einstein's neck until 1925.[1] He was elected an International Member of the American\nPhilosophical Society in 1930.[97]\nEinstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. His accomplishments in Berlin had\nincluded the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the Einstein\u2013de Haas effect,\ncontributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of Bose\u2013Einstein statistics.[48]\nIn 1907, Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new\nidea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in an\ninfinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that\nthe field exists. In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a\ndistant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's photosphere\n(that is, the Sun's apparent surface). He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to\nmodel gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime.

Aided by the Academic Assistance Council,\nfounded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi\npersecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[136] He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he\nlived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the\nBritish Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in\nthe preceding years.[131] Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded\nwooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-\nLampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein\nwas published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.[137][138]\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his\nhome, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister\nLloyd George.[139] Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish\nscientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes\nthat Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend,\nphysicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish\nscientists and place them in British universities.[140] Churchill\nlater observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews\nout, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the\nAllies' technology ahead of theirs.[140]\nEinstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including\nTurkey's Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, to whom he wrote in\nSeptember 1933, requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's\nletter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".[141]\nLocker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during\nwhich period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.[142]\nIn one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a\nbill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.[143] In his\nspeech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the\nUK.[note 3][144] Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute\nfor Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.[142]\nOn 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed\naudience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered\nthroughout.[136] Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced\nStudy,[142][145] noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.[146] At the time,\nmost American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or\nstudents, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.[146]\nEinstein was still undecided about his future. He had offers from several European universities, including\nChrist Church, Oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933[132]\nand was offered a five-year research fellowship (called a \"studentship\" at Christ Church),[147][148] but in\nResident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study"

He\nobserved, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\"[196]\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:\nThe word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses,\nthe Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty\nchildish.

I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.[197]\nEinstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth,\nvice-president of the German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund), he wrote:\nAlthough I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian\ndiet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle.

It reconciled conflicts between\nMaxwell's  equations  (the  laws  of  electricity  and  magnetism)  and  the  laws  of  Newtonian  mechanics  by\nintroducing changes to the laws of mechanics.[232] Observationally, the effects of these changes are most\napparent  at  high  speeds  (where  objects  are  moving  at  speeds  close  to  the  speed  of  light).  The  theory\ndeveloped in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n\fThis paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by\na moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion.\nThis paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether\u2014one of the leading theoretical entities in\nphysics at the time\u2014was superfluous.[note 4]\n\nIn  his  paper  on  mass\u2013energy  equivalence,  Einstein  produced  E  =  mc2  as  a  consequence  of  his  special\nrelativity  equations.[233]  Einstein's  1905  work  on  relativity  remained  controversial  for  many  years,  but\nwas accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.[note 5][234]\n\nEinstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908,\nHermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein\nadopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.[235]\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nGeneral relativity and the equivalence principle\n\nGeneral  relativity  (GR)  is  a  theory  of  gravitation  that  was  developed  by\nEinstein  between  1907  and  1915.  According  to  it,  the  observed\ngravitational  attraction  between  masses  results  from  the  warping  of\nspacetime  by  those  masses.  General  relativity  has  developed  into  an\nessential  tool  in  modern  astrophysics;  it  provides  the  foundation  for  the\ncurrent understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational\nattraction is so strong that not even light can escape.[236]\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity\nwas  that  the  preference  of  inertial  motions  within  special  relativity  was\nunsatisfactory,  while  a  theory  which  from  the  outset  prefers  no  state  of\nmotion  (even  accelerated  ones)  should  appear  more  satisfactory.[237]\nConsequently,  in  1907  he  published  an  article  on  acceleration  under\nspecial relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he\nargued  that  free  fall  is  really  inertial  motion,  and  that  for  a  free-falling  observer  the  rules  of  special\nrelativity must apply.

These solutions cut and\npasted  Schwarzschild  black  holes  to  make  a  bridge  between  two  patches.  Because  these  solutions\nincluded spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that\nthey could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles. However, it was\nlater found that Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges are not stable.[271]\n\nEinstein\u2013Cartan theory\n\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be\ngeneralized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion.

A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting\na body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall\nfreely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other\nmasses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial\namong physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to\nmove;  matter  tells  spacetime  how  to  curve.\"[272][273]  The  Einstein  field\nequations  cover  the  latter  aspect  of  the  theory,  relating  the  curvature  of\nspacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation\ncovers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that\nare as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. Einstein regarded this as\nan  \"independent  fundamental  assumption\"  that  had  to  be  postulated  in\naddition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. Believing\nthis  to  be  a  shortcoming  in  how  general  relativity  was  originally\npresented,  he  wished  to  derive  it  from  the  field  equations  themselves.\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy\nmade out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined\nby  the  Einstein  field  equations  themselves,  not  by  a  new  law. Accordingly,  Einstein  proposed  that  the\nfield equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both\nphysicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained\nfrom  applying  the  field  equations  to  the  motion  of  a  gravitational  singularity,  but  this  claim  remains\ndisputed.[274][275]\n\nEinstein at his office,\nUniversity of Berlin, 1920\n\nOld quantum theory"

            "Einstein and Niels Bohr,\n1925\n\n\fobject.  Einstein  reasoned  that  no  influence  could  propagate  from  the  first  object  to  the  second\ninstantaneously  fast.  Indeed,  he  argued,  physics  depends  on  being  able  to  tell  one  thing  apart  from\nanother,  and  such  instantaneous  influences  would  call  that  into  question.  Because  the  true  \"physical\ncondition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein\nconcluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of\nit.[291][292]\n\nA  more  famous  version  of  this  argument  came  in  1935,  when  Einstein  published  a  paper  with  Boris\nPodolsky  and  Nathan  Rosen  that  laid  out  what  would  become  known  as  the  EPR  paradox.[293]  In  this\nthought  experiment,  two  particles  interact  in  such  a  way  that  the  wavefunction  describing  them  is\nentangled. Then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on\none particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other\nparticle. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise\nprediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any\nway. They  argued  that  no  action  taken  on  the  first  particle  could  instantaneously  affect  the  other,  since\nthis  would  involve  information  being  transmitted  faster  than  light,  which  is  forbidden  by  the  theory  of\nrelativity.  They  invoked  a  principle,  later  known  as  the  \"EPR  criterion  of  reality\",  positing  that:  \"If,\nwithout  in  any  way  disturbing  a  system,  we  can  predict  with  certainty  (i.e.,  with  probability  equal  to\nunity)  the  value  of  a  physical  quantity,  then  there  exists  an  element  of  reality  corresponding  to  that\nquantity.\" From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and\nof  momentum  prior  to  either  quantity  being  measured.  But  quantum  mechanics  considers  these  two\nobservables  incompatible  and  thus  does  not  associate  simultaneous  values  for  both  to  any  system.\nEinstein,  Podolsky,  and  Rosen  therefore  concluded  that  quantum  theory  does  not  provide  a  complete\ndescription of reality.[294]"

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that if the wavefunction could predict the exact position or momentum of a particle, it would imply that the second particle must have definite values for these quantities before they were measured. Since quantum mechanics views position and momentum as incompatible observables, they concluded that the wavefunction could not represent the true physical state, only an incomplete description.",
        "output": "The main conclusion of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox was that quantum mechanics does not provide a complete description of reality. They argued that if one could predict certain physical quantities of a particle without disturbing it, then those quantities must correspond to real elements of reality. This conclusion highlighted the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with the classical notion of definite properties existing prior to measurement, suggesting that the theory fails to account for all aspects of physical reality. Thus, the EPR paradox raised fundamental questions about the nature of quantum entanglement and the completeness of quantum mechanics."

He deduced that if\nmeasurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the\nassumption  that  the  outcomes  depend  upon  hidden  variables  within  each  half  implies  a  mathematical\nconstraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. This constraint would later be\ncalled  a  Bell  inequality.  Bell  then  showed  that  quantum  physics  predicts  correlations  that  violate  this\ninequality.  Consequently,  the  only  way  that  hidden  variables  could  explain  the  predictions  of  quantum\nphysics  is  if  they  are  \"nonlocal\",  which  is  to  say  that  somehow  the  two  particles  are  able  to  interact\ninstantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated.[295][296] Bell argued that because an\nexplanation  of  quantum  phenomena  in  terms  of  hidden  variables  would  require  nonlocality,  the  EPR\nparadox \"is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least\".[297]\n\nDespite  this,  and  although  Einstein  personally  found  the  argument  in  the  EPR  paper  overly\ncomplicated,[291][292] that paper became among the most influential papers published in Physical Review.\nIt is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.[298]\n\nUnified field theory\n\nEncouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical\ntheory  that  would  treat  gravitation  and  electromagnetism  as  aspects  of  a  single  entity.  In  1950,  he\ndescribed  his  unified  field  theory  in  a  Scientific American  article  titled  \"On  the  Generalized Theory  of\nGravitation\".[299]  His  attempt  to  find  the  most  fundamental  laws  of  nature  won  him  praise  but  not\nsuccess: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak  nuclear  forces,  neither  of  which  was  well  understood  until  many  years  after  his  death. Although\nmost  researchers  now  believe  that  Einstein's  approach  to  unifying  physics  was  mistaken,  his  goal  of  a\ntheory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire.[300]"
